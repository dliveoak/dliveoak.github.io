University of Michigan

Hello! My name is DJ (Donald) Liveoak and I'm a first-year physics PhD student in the Department of Physics at the University of Michigan. I'm broadly interested in applying computational and analytical methods to solve problems in theoretical physics, including the formation and evolution of exoplanets to condensed matter systems.

I am an **NSF Graduate Research Fellow** and a recipient of the **Rackham Merit Fellow**. I received my B.S. in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2025, where I worked with Prof. Sarah Millholland on the formation and dynamics of exoplanetary systems and was awarded the **Barrett Prize for Research in Astrophysics** for my work.

Outside of academics, I'm deeply passionate about STEM outreach, including mentoring FIRST Robotics team and helping organize MIT's Research Science Institute. In my free time, I enjoy watching sports (go Lions!) and spending time with friends and family.
